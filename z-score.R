#1)for each grid cell find out the number of species that occur
#2) using a weighted random draw (weight based on area of occurance)
    #species with larger area are more likely to be drawn.
    #find 1000 times what a random mean size of occurance would be, then calculate population mean and sd
    #sample(x, size, replace = FALSE, prob = NULL)
#3) calculate z-score
    # z-score = (x-μ)/σ
    # 
    # x is a raw score to be standardized; 
    # μ is the mean of the population; 
    # σ is the standard deviation of the population.
